# LaTeX CV Project

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for Sworup Shakya's Frontend Developer resume.

## Compilation

To compile the resume, you will need a LaTeX distribution (such as TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX) installed on your system.

The main file is `frontend/CV-Frontend.tex`. This project uses a custom class file, `resume.cls`, which is included in the `frontend` directory.

To generate the PDF, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
pdflatex frontend/CV-Frontend.tex
```

This will create `CV-Frontend.pdf` in the `frontend` directory.
